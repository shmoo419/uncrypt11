# uncrypt11
#### @hackedbyshmoo

## Before I started writing this, I decided to use this opportunity to learn to use Vim. I haven't touched the source with anything other than Vim. It is my first time using Vim, so the source code will be messy and probably riddled with mistakes.

The difference between this and BFDecrypt is BFDecrypt dumps the entire IPA. I didn't like that because for my purposes I only need the executable.

I also do not want to encourage piracy, so I do not flip the cryptid. This tool is intended for research purposes only. This will never change.

This tool is in BETA. Please report any bugs/incompatible apps.
